# Pokémon Crystal Flair

This is an enhancement hack of Pokémon Crystal based on the disassembly of Pokémon Crystal (more info below).

If you've stumbled upon this hack then feel free to build and play it yourself! All badges should be obtainable unless I've messed something up somewhere.

This is a personal hack that I've been working on sporadically. I don't plan on advertising this since probably 80% of the changes are not originally mine. I've done my best to indicate where I got any non-original code in the commit descriptions as well as having a general credits list in FEATURES.md

Some of the notable features are:

(Please note: This hack is still incomplete in some regards, though it is possible to beat the Pokémon League and get all 16 badges (barring any unforseen bugs).)

* The addition of Fairy type.
* New evolution methods.
* Increased shiny odds (1/50).
* Physical Special Split.
* Gen 6 style exp gain.
* Individual menu icons with colors for every Pokémon and their shiny.
* Running shoes.
* Full text decapitalization.
* New maps. Some familiar ones restored, some got additions, and some completely new maps.
* All 251 Pokémon can be obtained.
* Tons of new events.
* Gym leaders and Elite Four members have full teams of 6 Pokémon. Gym leaders can also be rematched.
* Infinite TMs and deletable HMs.
* HMs can be used just by having the required badge, no more HM slaves.
* Pokémon stats updated to generation 8, some type reworks, and some move buffs.
* Tons of bug fixes.

For an extensive list of changes, look at the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file. 

A list of credits is located at the bottom of the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file.
